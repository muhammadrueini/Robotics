## Introduction
The Robotics Projects Repository aims to provide a wide range of practical examples and resources for robotics enthusiasts and developers. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced roboticist, you will find various projects and code samples that can help you learn and build your own robots.

## Projects
The repository includes a variety of robotics projects, such as:
- Autonomous Mobile Robots
- Robotic Arm Manipulation
- Quadcopters and Drones
- Computer Vision for Robotics
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Robot Navigation and Path Planning
- Humanoid Robots
- Robot Operating System (ROS) Projects
- Sensor Integration and Fusion

Each project is organized into its own directory and includes detailed documentation, source code, and instructions for implementation.

## Getting Started
If you're new to robotics, you can start with the "Beginner's Guide" directory, which provides step-by-step tutorials and introductory projects to help you get started.

For each project, make sure to read the project-specific README.md file for instructions on setup, dependencies, and running the code.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Robotics Projects Repository are welcome! If you have your own robotics projects, code samples, or resources that you would like to share with the community, please follow the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
